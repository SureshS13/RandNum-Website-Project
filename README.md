# RandNum.-Game-Website

In-Progress game website, with the aim to see if you can randomly generate the max number, 100.



Currently in prototype stages. I.E solidifying the basic outline of the main page and all functionalities, programming the basic Front-End HTML and JavaScript functionality.



Once complete, upcoming goals (tentative) are to:

- Use localStorage and sessionStorage to store score counts.

- Use Node.js with MySQL to create user functionality to store score counts.

- Add a high score page.


- Use CSS with Bootstrap to create an appealing and responsive web-layout

- etc
